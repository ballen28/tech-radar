<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose. Technologies with a usage in our production environments, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support our teams at dormakaba to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. 
</p>

<p>
Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, and using the <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">open-source implementation</a> popularized and developed by the great Zalando team, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
</p>


<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Technology Scouting Function of the Architecture, Technology, and Platforms Team</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the technology selection and evaluation at dormakaba.<br/>
</p>

<h3>About dormakaba Architecture, Technlogies, and Platforms</h3>


<p>
Check out our <a href="https://confluence.dormakaba.net/display/ATP/Architecture+and+Technology+Platforms+Home">Confluence Space</a> for more information on how we approach new technologies and use the Tech Radar. To sumbit a technology or question visit <a href="https://jira.dormakaba.net/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/141">our Jira Service Page</a> and provide as much detail as possible and we will follow up.

<h3>What are the technology segments?</h3>

<p>
We use four technlogy segments with the following definitions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AUTONOMY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that enable our products to think and act autonomously. This includes motion control, sensors, processors, and things like that. These technlogies give our products information about their environments, allow them to evaluate that information, and take action.</li>
<li><strong>SECURITY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that provide for digital and physical security of our products. This includes credentials, identity, secure key storage or cryptographic acceleration, or other similar technologies.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECTIVITY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that enable our products to communicate externally with other devices, services, or systems.</li>
<li><strong>ACCELERATORS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that broadly help us to do our jobs better while developing or somehow improve the performance of our products themselves. This could be engineering tools and platforms the make us more productive or energy savings technologies for products themselves. A catch-all for technologies that do not fit.</li>
</ul>
